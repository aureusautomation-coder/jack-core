# TOOLS.md - Local Notes

Skills define _how_ tools work. This file is for _your_ specifics — the stuff that's unique to your setup.

## Browser Automation (IMPORTANT)

**Do NOT use the built-in `browser` tool** — it uses the old Chrome Relay which is unreliable.

**Instead, always use the `browser_automation` skill** for ALL browsing tasks. This skill uses `exec` to run `curl` commands against `http://127.0.0.1:18800`. It is persistent, has approval gates, audit trails, and policy guardrails.

Examples:
- Navigate to a website → use browser_automation skill (curl to port 18800)
- Fill a form → use browser_automation skill
- Take a screenshot → use browser_automation skill
- Compare prices → use browser_automation skill
- Book an appointment → use browser_automation skill

The browser_automation SKILL.md has full documentation, examples, and all action types.

## Translation

You have built-in translation ability. When the user asks you to translate text to any language, do it directly — no external API needed. You are fluent in all major languages.

Common requests:
- "Translate this to Mandarin / 中文"
- "Translate this to Malay / Bahasa Melayu"
- "Translate this to Tamil / தமிழ்"
- "How do you say ___ in Japanese?"
- "Translate this email to English"

Always provide the translation in the target language's native script. If the user doesn't specify a target language, ask which language they want. For business contexts, use formal/professional tone unless told otherwise.

## Smart Notes (port 18809)

Use the `smart_notes` skill to save, search, and retrieve personal notes. This is the user's "second brain" — when they say "remember this" or "save this", use Smart Notes.

## Expense Tracker (port 18810)

Use the `expense_tracker` skill to log expenses, view spending, and get monthly summaries. When the user mentions spending money or wants to track an expense, use this skill.

## Daily Briefing (port 18811)

Use the `daily_briefing` skill to compose and deliver a morning briefing with calendar events, weather, and news headlines. Can also be triggered via cron for automated morning delivery.

## Voice Replies (port 18804)

Use the TTS service to generate voice messages. Send via exec + curl:

```bash
curl -s -X POST http://127.0.0.1:18804/speak \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text": "Your reply text here", "language": "zh"}'
```

Returns `{"ok": true, "url": "http://SERVER/audio/voice-xxx.mp3"}` — send that URL to the user.

### Supported languages
- English: `"language": "en"` (Kokoro voice)
- Chinese: `"language": "zh"` (Edge-TTS)
- Malay: `"language": "ms"` (Edge-TTS)
- Tamil: `"language": "ta"` (Edge-TTS)
- Japanese: `"language": "ja"` (Edge-TTS)
- Korean: `"language": "ko"` (Edge-TTS)
- Indonesian: `"language": "id"` (Edge-TTS)

### Auto voice reply rule
When the user sends a **voice message**, ALWAYS reply with BOTH:
1. A normal text reply
2. A voice reply in the **same language** they spoke in

## Environment-Specific Notes

Add your client-specific details below as you set up the environment:

- SSH hosts, aliases
- Camera names and locations (if applicable)
- Device nicknames
- Speaker/room names
- Anything environment-specific

## Why Separate?

Skills are shared. Your setup is yours. Keeping them apart means you can update skills without losing your notes, and share skills without leaking your infrastructure.

Add whatever helps you do your job. This is your cheat sheet.
